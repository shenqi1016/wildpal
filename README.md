WildPal is a boutique Channa‑fish studio by designer‑naturalist Adi. Born in Borneo’s streams and refined in Taiwan design, WildPal offers handcrafted acrylic tanks, custom LEDs, and “Pal Keeper Cards” to make fish care a mindful ritual. Beyond a pet shop, it’s a living ecosystem where nurturing fish means nurturing yourself.
